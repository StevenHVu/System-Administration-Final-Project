What will we do? How will we do it? 

# Prerequisites
- AWS account
- AWS CLI
- Terraform
- Command-line shell (powershell, bash, etc.)

# User configurations
To use the pipeline, you must configure your AWS CLI credentials. With your AWS account, on the page in which you can start a lab session, click on "AWS details". This will pull up important credentials such as the access key id, secret key, and session token. Save these in a file with the path `~/.aws/credentials`
